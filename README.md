![alt text](https://github.com/oscarpedrero/BloodyShop/blob/master/Images/userui.png?raw=true)

Being the first public version of the mod, I would like you to help me with the feedback if you use it, for this I have created a Test template to perform and in case of finding any error, I would like you to leave everything you have been able to on issue find or new ideas.
